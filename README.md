# .emacs.d

My personal emacs settings with inspiration from
https://github.com/magnars/.emacs.d and
https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d

## Setup

Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/martinp/dot.emacs.d`

Install symlink in ~/.emacs.d (this will overwrite any existing symlink):

```
cd dot.emacs.d
make install
```

Start emacs!
